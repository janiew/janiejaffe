description: An experimental single player game about making a record of
  something you love and then slowly and deliberately destroying the record.
  Originally published in March of 2019, the games rules are being played on
  itself. I have updated the game five times, each time destroying it slightly
  more. Some day it will not be a game but a destroyed record. A meditation on
  archive, technology, memory, and loss - I am immensely proud of it.
